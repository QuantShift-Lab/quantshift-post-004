# 💳 Credit Risk Assessment  
*A QuantShift-Lab Research Project*  

---

## 📘 Overview  
This repository is part of **QuantShift-Lab**, a research-driven initiative focused on the intersection of **data science, quantitative analysis, and financial modeling**.  
The **Credit Risk Assessment** project explores machine-learning-based methods for predicting credit card default risk using data from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients).

The primary goal is to build an interpretable, reproducible, and scalable pipeline that models customer credit behavior and quantifies default probabilities through statistical and machine learning techniques.

## 🔄 Current Progress & Beyond

### 🧹 **Phase 1: Data Exploration & Preparation (In Progress)**
- Imported and validated the UC Irvine Credit Card Default dataset.  
- Standardized column names, adjusted data types, and verified schema consistency.  
- Explored missing values, duplicates, and outlier behavior.  
- Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand demographic and behavioral drivers of default.  
- Identified class imbalance in the target variable and began assessing resampling strategies.  
- Documented workflow in `structure.ipynb` to ensure transparency and reproducibility.  

**Key Early Insights:**
- Payment history features (PAY_0–PAY_6) show strong correlation with default behavior.  
- Balance and limit ratios are likely to be key predictive variables.  
- Data imbalance will require mitigation via SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning.

### 🧠 **Phase 2: Model Development (Planned)**
- Construct baseline classification models:
  - Logistic Regression (interpretable benchmark).  
  - Random Forest and XGBoost (non-linear performance comparison).  
- Evaluate key metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.  
- Build confusion matrices and ROC curves to visualize model performance.  
- Implement k-fold and stratified cross-validation to validate results.  
- Integrate data balancing techniques (SMOTE, class-weighting) for improved recall on minority classes.  

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Baseline model comparison table.  
- Model evaluation notebook under `/notebooks`.  
- Initial write-up of findings for `/docs/baseline_report.md`.

### ⚙️ **Phase 3: Optimization & Explainability (Planned)**
- Apply hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV and Optuna for each model.  
- Engineer composite behavioral features (e.g., payment ratio, utilization, trend deltas).  
- Use feature selection methods (Recursive Feature Elimination, Mutual Information).  
- Introduce model interpretability layers:
  - SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for global and local feature effects.  
  - LIME for instance-level interpretability.  
- Establish version-controlled pipeline functions to streamline retraining.  

**Research Objective:**  
Enhance predictive accuracy while maintaining explainability — aligning with QuantShift-Lab’s commitment to interpretable AI in financial systems.  

---

### 📊 **Phase 4: Reporting & Visualization (Future Work)**
- Design visual dashboards to communicate credit risk insights:
  - Streamlit or Dash application for quick exploration.  
  - Seaborn/Matplotlib visualizations for feature distributions, correlations, and SHAP outputs.  
- Generate static reports (`/docs/reports/`) for internal reviews and academic reference.  
- Build a modular notebook template for reproducible experimentation across datasets.  

**Target Outcome:**  
Provide a transparent, interactive reporting system that bridges technical findings and business-level interpretation.

### 🧮 **Phase 5: Model Deployment & Scaling (Future Work)**
- Persist trained models using `joblib` for reproducibility.  
- Wrap inference pipeline in FastAPI for serving risk predictions via REST API.  
- Create Docker environment for isolated deployment testing.  
- Integrate GitHub Actions for CI/CD model retraining workflow.  
- Prepare cloud-deployment prototype (AWS S3 + EC2 or Lambda-based microservice).  

**Long-Term Goal:**  
Demonstrate a scalable architecture for ML-based credit risk scoring suitable for fintech and data science integration pipelines.  

---

### 🧭 **Phase 6: Quantitative Expansion & Research Continuity**
- Extend dataset with external macroeconomic variables (e.g., interest rates, inflation).  
- Test time-based models to explore behavioral drift and credit cycle effects.  
- Compare classical ML approaches with deep learning baselines (e.g., MLP, TabNet).  
- Develop a general-purpose credit scoring framework reusable for future QuantShift-Lab research.  
- Draft and publish a whitepaper summarizing methodology, results, and future directions.  

**Research Vision:**  
This project aims to evolve into a reproducible credit risk modeling framework — bridging **data science, financial modeling, and interpretability** within QuantShift-Lab’s open research ecosystem.
