    "# Building Elasticity: A Streamlit Project Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s been a couple of weeks since my last post — and no, I haven’t disappeared into the fintech void. Quite the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve been building a new project that combines economic theory, data wrangling, and web-based visualization. The topic?\n",
    "📉 **Price Elasticity of Demand** — and how it affects revenue across different pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is a sneak peek into a larger blog + app combo I’m currently working on. The full project will feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **DuckDB** backend to manage and query data locally\n",
    "- A **Streamlit** frontend to explore revenue and elasticity interactions\n",
    "- A dataset with real-world (and messy) sales data\n",
    "- Visual tools to help users understand how pricing impacts total revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠 Tools I’m Using\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DuckDB** for blazing-fast SQL queries without a server\n",
    "- **Pandas** for data cleanup and transformation\n",
    "- **Streamlit** (my first time using it!) to deploy an interactive, browser-based app\n",
    "- **Matplotlib / Plotly** for visualizing elasticity curves and revenue inflection points\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📸 Here’s a Peek (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Insert a screenshot or graph here if you’re ready — even a histogram or partial UI is great]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticity isn't just an economics concept — it’s a critical tool in everything from infrastructure planning to fintech strategy.\n",
    "Whether you're optimizing water usage pricing for a city utility or adjusting SaaS subscriptions, **understanding price sensitivity is essential**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that’s what this app aims to explore:\n",
    "> What happens to revenue when prices change — and how can we visualize that in real time?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚧 Coming Soon\n",
    "\n",
    "The full breakdown will walk through:\n",
    "- The elasticity formula (with code)\n",
    "- Building a DuckDB pipeline\n",
    "- Developing the Streamlit app\n",
    "- Revenue vs. price curve interpretation\n",
    "- Use cases in both **engineering** and **fintech**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stay tuned — and if you’ve worked with Streamlit before, I’m all ears for tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
