    "# Building Elasticity: A Streamlit Project Preview\n",

    "It’s been a couple of weeks since my last post — and no, I haven’t disappeared into the fintech void. Quite the opposite.\n",

    "I’ve been building a new project that combines economic theory, data wrangling, and web-based visualization. The topic?\n",

    "\n",
    "- A **DuckDB** backend to manage and query data locally\n",
    "- A **Streamlit** frontend to explore revenue and elasticity interactions\n",
    "- A dataset with real-world (and messy) sales data\n",
    "- Visual tools to help users understand how pricing impacts total revenue\n",

    "- **DuckDB** for blazing-fast SQL queries without a server\n",
    "- **Pandas** for data cleanup and transformation\n",

    "### 📊 A First Look at the Data: Something’s Off\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first steps in the project was to visualize raw sales data. When I plotted a histogram of transaction volumes, this is what I saw:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Raw Data Histogram](../figures/histogram_raw_data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, it looked like **most of the transactions had zero sales** — which didn’t make intuitive sense given the source of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧐 What’s Going On Here?\n",
    "\n",
    "This spike at zero was suspicious. Here’s what I did to investigate:\n",
    "- Checked for **missing or null values** disguised as zeros\n",
    "- Explored whether zeros represented **days stores were closed** or **out-of-stock scenarios**\n",
    "- Compared this with other columns like inventory, store ID, and date ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, it became clear that this zero-heavy chunk was **not useful** for understanding price elasticity — because it wasn't driven by price behavior, but likely by **non-pricing operational factors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧹 Why It Had to Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Including this in the analysis would skew revenue calculations and elasticity estimates — making prices seem more \"inelastic\" than they actually are.\n",
